When constructing the database, please:
1. In positional ratings, ignore the "+x" value. E.g. "89+3" should be treated as 89.
2. Transfer natural years to seasons. E.g. 20 -> 19/20; 21 -> 20/21.
3. Need to manually associate leagues to countries. E.g. English Premier League -> England.
4. Both short name and full name of a player should be included.
5. player_id alone can only determine date_of_birth.
